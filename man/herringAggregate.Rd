\title{Allocates 4X herring index into sets based on the RV survey.}
\usage{
herringAggregate(path, s.year, e.year)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Filepath indicating where to create folders to store the extracted
data.}

\item{s.year}{Year for which to begin data extraction.}

\item{e.year}{Year for which to end data extraction.}
}
\description{
This function is called by \code{biomassData} to allocate the 4X
 herring index from XXXX into sets based on the proportion from the resaerch
 vessel survey.
}
\details{
User must define \code{channel = odbcConnect("ptran", uid = ###, pwd
 = ###)} in the global environment. This channel must have access to the XXXX
 databases.

 The 4X herring index is based on XXXX. This data must be stored in
 path/extra info/**name.csv.

 The /code{ABUNDNACE} in **name.csv is allocated across the research vessel
 summer strata based on a stratification/destratification scheme:

 1. Stratify research vessel survey \code{ABUNDANCE} and determine the total
 \code{ABUNDANCE} over the whole area.

 2. Calculate the proportion of the total \code{ABUNDANCE} that is
 contributed by each strata.

 3.  Calculate the proportion of the mean \code{ABUNDANCE} in each strata
 that is contributed by each set.

 4. Use the proportions in 2. and 3. to destratify the 4X herring index
 \code{ABUNDACE}.

 5. Use the mean weight of fish to calculate the \code{BIOMASS} in each set:
 \deqn{\code{BIOMASS} = \code{ABUNDANCE} * Weight_{Avg}}
